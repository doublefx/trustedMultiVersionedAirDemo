============================

A simple example to demonstrate how to (and despite the Adobe AIR security documentation) load an untrusted multi-versioned AIR application into the main security context and a sibling application domain and therefore benefits in the remote application of all the AIR API.

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/doublefx/trustedMultiVersionedAirDemo/wiki) for more details.
